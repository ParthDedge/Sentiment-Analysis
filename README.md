## 🤔 What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis (also known as **opinion mining**) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to identify and extract opinions or emotions expressed in textual data. It helps determine whether the sentiment behind a text is **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** — and sometimes even more granular emotions like **joy**, **anger**, or **sadness**.

## 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Action

Twitter is a goldmine of real-time opinions. This project focuses on analyzing sentiment from tweets using machine learning.

### 🔍 How It Works:

1. **Collect Tweets**  
   Gather tweets about a specific topic (e.g., a new video game).

2. **Analyze Words**  
   The program identifies keywords like “love,” “hate,” “excited,” or “disappointed” that indicate emotions.

3. **Classify Sentiment**  
   Tweets are categorized as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** based on emotional cues.

This allows us to quickly understand public opinion on trending topics!

## 🛠️ Project Pipeline

### 📥 1. Data Collection
- Tweets are collected (manually or via APIs) and labeled with appropriate sentiment categories.

### 🧹 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean text (removing special characters, stopwords, and noise).
- Normalize and tokenize the text data.

### 🧠 3. Feature Extraction
- Use techniques like **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical vectors.

### 🏗️ 4. Model Building
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes) to classify sentiment.

### 📈 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
